                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p class="bio">Nick Magruder was born in Dallas, TX way back in the ancient days of the late 1980s. Did you know he didn't even have a cell phone when he was growing up? Wow. He also briefly lived in Florida before returning home to attend the University of North Texas. Originally studying design and photography, he switched to International Studies and graduated with a B.A. in International Development with a minor in Spanish. UNT is where Nick became passionate about environmental and climate issues, seeing first-hand the pollution and destruction rought by hydraulic fracturing (or fracking).</p>
                <p class="bio">In 2014 Nick took his environmentalist notions, his wonderful wife April and his tiny tabby Frau Blucher cross-country to the gorgeous city of Seattle. He worked for the last 6 years in Seattle as a climate campaigner and non-profit fundraiser for organizations such as Environment Washington and the Arboretum Foundation. Though in his heart he's always been a big nerd, for the longest time Nick never saw himself working in tech. Somehow, after being laid-off from a boring, repetitive data-entry position at the Seattle Symphony Nick was ready for a change. After soulsearching, Nick realized he needed a career change, and that coding was a skill always lacked in his non-profit jobs. He even realized that he could likely make a bigger impact helping non-profits as a skilled volunteer coder, than as a regular employee.</p>
                <p class="bio">Nick is now a training to be a Software Developer at the illustrious CodeFellows school in Seattle. He wants to start an exciting, interesting and mentally-challenging career. He would also love to someday soon be able to afford a small sailboat for cruising around the beautiful waters of Puget Sound.</p>
